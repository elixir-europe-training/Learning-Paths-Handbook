## What is this step about?
Identify TARGET AUDIENCE is the second step in this protocol. The goal is to identify key aspects and characteristics of the target audience (learners) to tailor the learning path to their learning needs. This includes characteristics such as what level of knowledge/expertise they are at, corresponding with the target audience experience and exposure to the domain (step 1), areas (step 3) and topics (step 4) and their stage i.e corresponding knowledge level (step 4). 

## What is TARGET AUDIENCE?
!!! info "TARGET AUDIENCE is ..."

    - Within teaching and learning contexts, a target audience is a specific group of learners
    - Alternative words used for target audience: learners


## Why do we need to identify TARGET AUDIENCE?
- Helps you understand who you are designing the learning path for and what their learning needs are.
- Defines the scope of the learning path
- Important to align the lesson design with the the specific needs and characteristics of the target audience
- Helps in determining desired learning outcomes
- Ensures the learning path is more effective by aligning with the motivations, background, and expertise of the target audience
- When displayed, it can help attract learners with the right motivation and sufficient prior knowledge to engage successfully with the training.



## How do we identify TARGET AUDIENCE?
- Think about the expected background (general level of expertise, educational background, or professional experience you expect the audience to have when engaging with the LP)
- Refine your understanding of their needs (identify what the target audience already knows and what gaps may exists in their knowledge and motivation; use tools like surveys, forms to gather this information)
- Be Specific (clearly define characteristics such as skill level and domain-specific knowledge)
- Define Prerequisite Knowledge (minimum level of knowledge or skills that learners must have before starting the Learning Path.)

## Use-case example
- Bioinformatics for Genomics Learning Path
In this example, the target audience consists of postgraduate students, who could be either PhD or master students.
