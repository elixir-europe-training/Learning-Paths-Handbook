## What is this step about?
While the first two steps (identifying the domain and target audience) focus on planning, this step marks the beginning of the design phase of the protocol (steps 3-6). In this phase, the content of the learning path (LP) is organised and structured, creating the framework that will guide the development of educational/training materials. The protocol represents this phase as a cyclical process, emphasising the necessity of iteration, by moving back and forth between steps to ensure alignment and coherence.
The design phase begins with identifying the key Areas of knowledge that will be covered throughout the LP. These Areas form the foundation for the subsequent step, where specific topics within each Area are detailed to align the LP with both educational objectives and learners' needs. 
As part of this cyclical process, the creation of a roadmap/concept map begins. This map provides both a logical and visual representation of the LP, serving as a dynamic tool to guide content structuring and to communicate the LP framework clearly to stakeholders.


## What are AREA(S)

!!! info "An AREA is ..."

    In this context, AREA refers to a broad category of expertise that includes related topics (detailed, discrete units of knowledge) (step 4) to be covered during the learning path. Areas, such as domains (step 1) and topics (step 3), have no clearly defined borders between each other (EDAM).

## Why do we need to identify AREA(S)?
- knowledge areas help in structuring the LP logically and systematically (from scratch). It serves as an intermediate level of organisation within a LP/curriculum, lying between general domains and specific topics
- they provide a clear roadmap for both educators and learners, enhancing the learning experience
- this structured approach facilitates and ensures a comprehensive educational experience, tailored to cover all necessary competencies
- this approach gives freedom to the LP designer (who is an expert in the domain (see Step 1)) to best include all topics (step 4) to be covered in all identified areas during the learning path

## How do we identify AREA(S)?
- this protocol wants to be a user-friendly and flexible protocol that can be adapted to various contexts for implementing LPs (TeSS, academic context, institutions, etc.); when implementing a LP in a platform like TeSS, it could be useful to leverage existing keywords and vocabulary (to ensure consistency and discoverability)
- for each learning path (LP), we start with a manageable number of knowledge Areas (5-6 maximum) or (to go beyond this number) Areas closely connected to the overall subject to facilitate the structuring of the content
- ensure that the Areas cover competencies and skills to be includes into the LP
- ensure that the Areas are neither too broad or too narrow, and adjust the number of areas if necessary
- review and refine the knowledge Areas based on the topics identified in the following step
- conduct a final review and revision of the knowledge Areas at the end of the protocol cycle
- use the framework (link)
