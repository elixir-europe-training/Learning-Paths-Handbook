## What is this step about?
- once domain and target audience have been identified, this is the first step of the cycle part of the protocol
- in this step, all the areas of knowledge that will be addressed during the learning path are identified
- the structure of knowledge areas and topics (defined in the following step) is used to guide the delivery of content


## What are AREA(S)

!!! info "An AREA is ..."

    In this context, AREA refers to a broad group of knowledge that includes related topic(s) (more granular and detailed units of knowledge) (step 4) to be covered during the learning path. Areas, such as domains (step 1) and topics (step 3), have no clearly defined borders between each other [EDAM](https://edamontology.github.io/edam-browser/#topic_0003).

## Why do we need to identify AREA(S)?
- knowledge areas help in structuring the LP logically and systematically (from scratch). It serves as an intermediate level of organisation within a LP/curriculum, lying between general domains and specific topics
- they provide a clear roadmap for both educators and learners, enhancing the learning experience
- this structured approach facilitates and ensures a comprehensive educational experience, tailored to cover all necessary competencies
- this approach gives freedom to the LP designer (who is an expert in the domain (see Step 1)) to best include all topics (step 4) to be covered in all identified areas during the learning path

## How do we identify AREA(S)?
- this protocol wants to be a user-friendly and flexible protocol that can be adapted to various contexts for implementing LPs (TeSS, academic context, institutions, etc.); when implementing a LP in a platform like TeSS, it could be useful to leverage existing keywords and vocabulary (to ensure consistency and discoverability)
- for each learning path (LP), we start with a manageable number of knowledge Areas (5-6 maximum) or (to go beyond this number) Areas closely connected to the overall subject to facilitate the structuring of the content
- ensure that the Areas cover competencies and skills to be includes into the LP
- ensure that the Areas are neither too broad or too narrow, and adjust the number of areas if necessary
- review and refine the knowledge Areas based on the topics identified in the following step
- conduct a final review and revision of the knowledge Areas at the end of the protocol cycle
- use the LP framework (link) (?)
