## What is this step about?
While the first two steps (identifying the domain and target audience) focus on planning, this step marks the beginning of the design phase of the protocol (steps 3-6). In this phase, the content of the learning path (LP) is organised and structured, creating the framework that will guide the development of educational/training materials. The protocol represents this phase as a cyclical process, emphasising the necessity of iteration, by moving back and forth between steps to ensure alignment and coherence.
The design phase begins with identifying the key Areas of knowledge that will be covered throughout the LP. These Areas form the foundation for the subsequent step, where specific topics within each Area are detailed to align the LP with both educational objectives and learners' needs. 
As part of this cyclical process, the creation of a roadmap/concept map begins. This map provides both a logical and visual representation of the LP, serving as a dynamic tool to guide content structuring and to communicate the LP framework clearly to stakeholders.
