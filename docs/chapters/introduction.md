This six-step protocol is designed for training providers, curriculum developers, and educators seeking a straightforward and adaptable framework for building Learning Paths across various contexts. 

Accompanied by detailed guidelines, best practices, and examples, the protocol provides a step-by-step approach to failitate creation of effective Learning Paths. Its focus is on fostering lifelong learning by providing a structured yet adaptable framework that supports continuous skill development and knowledge acquisition.


!!! note "Definition"

    A Learning Path is a structured pathway that guides learners through a curated and ordered selection of training modules —such as courses or training materials— progressively moving from foundational to advanced cognitive skills. By the end of the pathway, learners acquire the targeted knowledge and skills in a specific subject area.

Learning Paths are highly beneficial as they not only break complex learning content into manageable units but also ensure that the material is absorbed progressively. This approach guarantees that learners meet the necessary prerequisites at each stage, enabling them to tackle subsequent content with confidence and a solid foundation.


!!! note "Key Properties of Learning Paths"

    - **Progressive:** each step builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity
    - **Directional:** there is a trajectory from the beginning to an end point
    - **Goal-Oriented:** aimed at mastering a subject
