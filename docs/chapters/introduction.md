This six-step protocol is designed for training providers, curriculum developers, and educators seeking a straightforward and adaptable framework for building Learning Paths across various contexts. 
Accompanied by detailed guidelines, best practices, and practical advice, the protocol provides a step-by-step approach to creating effective Learning Paths. Its focus is on fostering the systematic development of knowledge, skills, and abilities to empower learners and enhance their educational journey.


!!! note "Note"

    A Learning Path refers to a pathway that guides the learner through a selection of training modules (that could be courses or training materials) to be undertaken progressively, from lower to higher thinking skills, to acquire the desired knowledge and skills on a subject by the end of the pathway. 
    
    Learning paths are beneficial because they make the learning content digestible and effective.


## Key Properties of Learning Paths

- **Progressive:** each step builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity.
- **Directional:** there is a trajectory from the beginning to an end point.
- **Goal-Oriented:** aimed at mastering a subject, adapting to different backgrounds and knowledge levels.
