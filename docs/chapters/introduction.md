This six-steps protocol is intended for training providers, curriculum developers, and trainers, and it can be used as a simple and flexible tool to help build structured Learning Paths in different contexts.
This protocol is accompanied by guidelines, best practices, and general advice that will facilitate to create step-by-step constructive Learning Paths aimed to increase the knowledge, skills and abilities of the learners.


!!! note "Note"

    A Learning Path refers to a pathway that guides the learner through a selection of training modules (that could be courses or training materials) to be undertaken progressively, from lower to higher thinking skills, to acquire the desired knowledge and skills on a subject by the end of the pathway. 
    
    Learning paths are beneficial because they make the learning content digestible and effective.


## Key Properties of Learning Paths

- **Progressive:** each step builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity.
- **Directional:** there is a trajectory from the beginning to an end point.
- **Goal-Oriented:** aimed at mastering a subject, adapting to different backgrounds and knowledge levels.
