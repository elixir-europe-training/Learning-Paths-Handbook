It offers a wide range of materials, including guidelines, case studies, examples, training resources, and best practices, all aimed at supporting lifelong learning and the develoment of expertise across various domains. The content is structured to guide users through key steps of Learning Path design and implementation.  In the \u201cDesigning Learning Paths\u201d section, you will find a simple and flexible six-step protocol that outlines practical steps for approaching the planning of Learning Paths tailored to specific target audiences and learning needs.  The \u201cCase Studies\u201d section provides real-world examples of Learning Paths successfully applied in various settings, offering insights into effective design choices and lessons learned.  The handbook also emphasises the importance of integration and alignment with the Training Platform within ELIXIR in the corresponding \u201cELIXIR Training Platform (Connections and Integration)\u201d section, showcasing how Learning Paths can be linked and embedded within a broader training ecosystem to maximise their impact.   For further learning and exploration, the \u201cUseful Online Resources\u201d section provides curated links and resources that can support ongoing research and application of Learning Path approaches.  A unique feature of this handbook is its collaborative nature, highlighted in the \u201cA Collaborative Journey\u201d section, which shares the story of how this project was created and developed collaboratively within the context of a Research Infrastructure. This section underscores the importance of contributions from a diverse community of experts, ensuring the handbook remains dynamic and relevant.   Additionally, this handbook is not static\u2014it is designed to grow and evolve. You will have the opportunity to contribute by sharing your own experiences, feedback, and updates, helping to keep the content aligned with the latest developments in Learning Path methodologies. By contributing, you can become part of a community of like-minded individuals passionate about enhancing educational design and implementation. </p> <p> Prerequisites  To effectively read and use this handbook, learners should have:  </p> <ol> <li>foundational knowledge in basic principles of education and curriculum development</li> <li>familiarity with instructional design frameworks</li> <li>general understanding of the subject matter or domain for which Learning Paths will be developed.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p> Learning Outcomes: By consulting this handbook, learners will be able to:</p> <ol> <li>design structured Learning Paths tailored to specific educational or professional goals</li> <li>find examples and case studies to inspire the development of their Learning Paths</li> <li>gain an overview of how Learning Paths can be integrated into training programs, such as the ones delivered by ELIXIR</li> <li>collaborate more effectively with teams or stakeholders to plan and implement Learning Paths across various domains.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p> Target Audience: Training providers, trainers, professors, educators, researchers, and anyone with an interest in educational science.  </p> <p> License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</p> <p> Funding: This project has received funding from ELIXIR (tbc)   </p>"},{"location":"#authors","title":"Authors","text":"<p>Zeus</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Athena</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Poseidon</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Greek Mythology icons made by max.icons from www.flaticon.com</p>"},{"location":"#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>Artemis</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Ares</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Nike</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Prometheus</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Perseus</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p> <p>Hercules</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. </p>"},{"location":"#citing-this-handbook","title":"Citing this Handbook","text":"<p>Please cite as:</p> <ol> <li>Enter your citation here.</li> <li>Geert van Geest, Elin Kronander, Jose Alejandro Romero Herrera, Nadja \u017dlender, &amp; Alexia Cardona.
